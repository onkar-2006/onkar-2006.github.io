## 🔭 Current Projects
Here’s what I’m currently diving into:
- **[Potato diease prediction]**: [             Potato is one of the most important crops worldwide, and its productivity can be affected by various diseases, including leaf diseases. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of leaf diseases can help prevent their spread and minimize crop losses. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown great potential in image classification tasks, including disease detection in plants. In this study, we propose a CNN-based approach for the prediction of potato leaf diseases. The proposed method uses a pre-trained CNN model, which is fine-tuned on a dataset of potato leaf images. The dataset includes images of healthy leaves and leaves infected with different diseases such as early blight and late blight. The trained model is then used to classify new images of potato leaves into healthy or diseased categories.

- **[Heart desiase prediction]**: [n this project, we leverage machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various health metrics. By analyzing factors such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant features, our model aims to identify individuals at risk, enabling early intervention and improved health outcomes. Join us as we explore the data and uncover insights that could potentially save lives!].

- **[Spam classifier]**: [       Spam detection is the process of identifying and categorizing unwanted messages, like spam emails, as spam or not spam. The goal is to keep users' inboxes free of potentially harmful information. by using the Natural language processing build a model that classify the given mail is spam or not ].
